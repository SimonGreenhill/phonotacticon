"Lect","Note"
"Abaza","``Lamino-post-alveolar'' and ``apico-palatal'' are interpreted as alveolo-palatal and palato-alveolar, respectively. ``Fronted dorso-velar'' is interpreted as palatalized velar. The ``[d]orso-palatal voiced lateral fricative'' is transcribed as <ʟ>."
"Andi","``Смычно-гортаные'' interpreted as ejective."
"Aragonese","The ``palatal medial approximant'' <ʝ̞> was transcribed as <j>."
"Archi","The palato-velar affricates transcribed as <kɬ kɬʷ kɬʼ kɬʼʷ> were excluded, as they are not present in PanPhon."
"Aromanian","``Prepalatal and palatal occlusives/fricatives'' interpreted as alveolo-palatal and palato-alveolar affricatives/fricatives. Although the triphthong /uVu/ is logically possible, it is not given as an example; here it is assumed to exist."
"Arpitan","The distinction between the two rhotic consonants, only present intervocally, is between a tap and a trill and/or between an alveolar or an uvular consonant, depending on the speaker (pp. 65--66). Here, they are transcribed as an aveolar tap and an uvular fricative. The source suggests that /ɾ/, which is the only word-final consonant, may be the only coda as well, while not excluding alternative analyses of syllabification (e.g. /ves.tă/ vs. /ve.stă/) that would imply more varieties of coda (p. 94). Here it is treated as the only coda."
"Bagvalal","The ``shipjash'ije'' [hushing] consonants are transcribed here as as alveo-palatal."
"Baharna Arabic","The phonemic status of /ɑ ɑː/ is unclear, hence not listed here. ``Initial'' consonant clusters are interpreted as onset clusters."
"Bashkir","The source only provides the list of word-medial intervocalic clusters and no word-final clusters. For the analysis here, it is assumed that all word-medial clusters are heterosyllabic (VC.CV). The maximal syllable structure, CVCC, is that of the native words (p. 12)."
"Bhojpuri","The list of diphthongs and triphthongs does not seem to be comprehensive, but given its sufficient length, it is coded here as if it were comprehensive."
"Budukh","``Long vowels occur in loanwords, e.g. laːzɨm, `it is necessary', and a few others.'' The comprehensive list of long vowels were not given. Here it is assumed that all short vowels have long counterparts"
"Burushaski","``The restriction of [coda] clusters in loan words is less strict than the one in indigenous words: e.g., qulp ‘lock’ < [Urdu] qufl ( قفل ) ‘id.’.'' (p. 18)"
"Catalan","Eastern variety. ``Prepalatal'' consonants are transcribed as palato-alveolar. It wasn't certain whether the source analyzes VV sequences as nucleus-internal diphthongs as onset-nucleus/nucleus-coda sequences. Here they are transcribed as nuclues-internal diphthongs. The diphthongs were not comprehensively listed, but here it is assumed that all the logical combinations of iV, uV, Vi, and Vu are possible. ([ii]] and [uu] are also possible, cf. p. 385). /ŋ/ is here analyzed as a phoneme contra the source's analysis of /Nk/ > [ŋ], as it always surfaces as [ŋ]. It varies between [ŋ] and [ŋk] before a vowel (p. 373), but even in the case of [ŋk] it can still be analyzed as [ŋ] with a [k] that is deleted in other environments. I thus see no reason to not consider it to be a phoneme other than historical reasons."
"Chechen","``All (or probably all) vowels also occur nasalized'' (p. 8). Here it is assumed that this applies to diphthongs as well. When transcribing nasalized diphthongs, only the vocalic segments (and not the semivocalic segments) were transcribed as nasalized."
"Chong of Chanthaburi","Khlong Phlu variety. The four ``registers'' are here coded as tones."
"Chukchi","V1CV2 varies with V2V2, e. g. [qoɾa] ~ [qaa] `reindeer' (pp. 42-43). Here the V2V2 sequences are interpreted as long vowel phonemes, as they occur tautosyllabically. /t͡s/ in the women's variety corresponds to /s/ in the men's variety. Here, the women's variety is chosen, as the source reports that ``women's Chukchi is not only universal among female speakers of Chukchi, but that due to better rates of language retention among women it comprises the most widely known and used form of the language'' (p. 6). Glottalization, which is a suprasegmental feature according to the source, is not coded here."
"Chuvash","Completed with personal communication with the author."
"Deori","The tone system is described as moribund (p. 74)."
"Dhimal","``Consonant clusters, although not common, do occur due to compounding, elision and word borrowing. Except for the aforementioned cases, the only permitted medials are /y/ and /w/'' (p. 41). Here, only /Cj/ and /Cw/ are listed as possible (onset) clusters, as other exceptional cases were not listed in the source."
"Domari","``[The] phonemic status [of /ʔ/] in word-initial position is controversial, as it tends to disappear in word boundaries ... It is retained, however, after a meaningful pause or else to emphasise a word boundary, in post-vocalic position in the inherited existential negation expression, as well as in Arabic lexemes'' (p. 45). Here it is included as a possible onset."
"Duhumbi","``Pre-glottalised, creaky, rising pitch'' vowels <á̰ˀ ḛ́ˀ ɔ̰́ˀ ṵ́ˀ> are transcribed here as <aˀ eˀ ɔˀ uˀ>."
"Dungan","The source notes that rhoticization (``erhua'') is productive (p. 37) without giving the comprehensive list of rhoticized rhymes. Here I treat rhoticized rhymes as a /Və˞/ sequence (where /ə˞/ is the coda) by adding a /ə˞/ phoneme not mentioned in the source."
"Duoluo Gelao","The source suggests that /pz/ could be a variant of the phoneme /p/ instead of a biphonemic cluster (p. 7)."
"Dzongkha","``Devoiced'' obstruents (transcribed as <b̥ d̥ ɖ̥ ...> in the source) are interpreted as breathy voiced consonants, as their characteristics include ``breathy voice quality in the following vowel'' (pp. 28-29). The ``heteroorganic affricates'' are interpreted as plosive-affricate clusters, contra the source's analysis of them being single phonemes. Tonal contrast is emergent, but not reflected here."
"Eastern Balochi","It is unclear whether diphthongs can be nasalized as well."
"Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic","Based on Chapter One, ``A Description Of The Dialects Of The Ǧbāliyyah, Awlād Sa‘īd, ṢawālḤah, Garāršah And Ḥamāḍah''. ``Postalveolar'' <š ž> are interpreted as /ɕ ʑ/."
"Eastern Katu","It is unclear what the codas transcribed as <u i W? i? ih> signify. Here I interpret them as /w j wˀ iˀ j̥/."
"Eastern Newari","It is assumed that /ww/ and /jj/ are not possible onset clusters, although they would be technically possible based on the source's description."
"Eastern Tamang","``Nasality is marginally distinctive ... Nasal vowels only occur with Nepali loan word'' (p. 15)."
"Estonian Swedish","Long consonants were not transcribed as independent phonemes as they seemed to be either allophonic variations or geminates from what I have seen in the source. The consonant clusters are not totally comprehensive, as the rare ones were excluded in the source."
"Fars Dialects","It was not clear what the diphthong transcribed as <oi> refers to, hence it was omitted."
"Friulian","The source reports that the ``final [voiced] consonants are extremely rare'' (p. 219). As the source only gives four words with final /d/ as examples of singleton final voiced consonants, I assume that /d/ is the only voiced consonant appearing as a singleton coda. It is unclear whether the vowel clusters are diphthongs. But given that the stress falls on each vowel and not on each vowel cluster, I assume that the vowel clusters are not heterosyllabic."
"Galo","The status of diphthongs is uncertain. The coda <K> is realized as /k/ word-finally, realized as /ɡ/ intervocalically, and fully assimilated to the following consonant preconsonantally. Here it is treated as /k/."
"Georgian","The ``glottalized'' consonants are transcribed here as ejectives. /h/ not included. Based on the source's analysis, sonorants that are not adjacent to the vowel are considered as syllabic. The disyllabic sequences arising from the syllabification of sonorants in triconsonantal or longer sequences, e.g. the stop + sonorant sequences arising from sonorant + stop + sonorant sequences, where the first sonorant is syllabified, are assumed to be a subset of the disyllabic sequences listed in p. 110. It is unclear what the coda restrictions are, but given that only singleton consonants appear word-finally (p. 79, p. 85), I assume that codas can only be monosyllabic. Although the source analyzes certain clusters, such as /s/ + obstruent, not ``genuine'' clusters but rather ``complex segments'' (p. 112), here they are all treated as clusters."
"Gheg Albanian","The ``dorso-interdental'' <L> is transcribed as /ʟ/. The ``voiced postdental vibrant'' <R> is transcribed as /ʀ/. The ``dorso-pharyngeal'' <x> is transcribed as /x/. <j> is described both as a fricative and a semivowel, here it is interpreted as a semivowel."
"Gilaki","The onset cluster /bɾ/ and the syllabic structure CrC are mentioned once in p. 62 but not listed as part of the possible clusters or syllabic structures."
"Goan Konkani","It is unclear how many consonants are allowed in coda clusters. Based on the examples given in p. 26, I assume that it is maximally three. The nature of the diphthong phonemes <əy> and <əw> are also not clear. Here they are assumed to be biphonemic sequences, like other diphthongs presented in the source."
"Godwari","Nasalization contrast is marginal and was not fully described (p. 18)."
"Guiqiong","It was not clear whether the list of diphthongs (p. 24) is comprehensive."
"Gujarati","Vocalic nasality is analyzed in the source as <N>, a suprasegmental phoneme <N>, which can surface as [ŋ] in the environment of /ə...k/ or /ə...ɡ/ and as [ɲ] in the environment of /ə...t͡ɕ/ and /ə...d͡ʑ/. In this database, I have not analyzed <N> as a phoneme but instead included the nasal counterparts of all oral vowels as separate phonemes, as I have done for all other lects that have distinctive vocalic nasality. I am not sure how to reflect its allophonic variation as [ŋ] or [ɲ] in the context of the database, so I regret to leave it omitted. It is uncertain whether the following onset clusters are possible: /ʈh ħh ɳj ɳh nh mh ɭh lh ɾh ɡhj ʈhj ɖhj t͡ɕhj d͡ʑhj thj phj bhj ħhj ɲhj nhj mhj ɭhj lhj ɾhj/. It is also uncertain whether /Ch/ codas other than /Ph/ codas are possible."
"Halbi","Vowel nasality is introduced as a suprasegmental phoneme and it is unclear whether all vowels have nasalized counterparts. Here it is assumed that they do. The source states that only homoorganic sequences of nasal-plosive are possible in the word-final position, apparently including sequences like alveolar-retroflex and alveolar-palatal."
"Hijazi Arabic","Although /ʔ/ does not occur in word-final position, given the medial cluster /ʔð/ in /maʔðuːn/ `judge' (p. 20), it is assumed to appear in the coda position."
"Hindi","Non-native clusters not included. Triconsonantal medial clusters occur both in loanwords and native words. I have only analyzed those given with native word examples. Among those, /nɟ͡jr/ and /nɟ͡jʰl/ are analyzed as /nɟ͡j.r/ and /nɟ͡jʰ.l/ instead of /n.ɟ͡jr/ and /n.ɟ͡jʰl/, given that plosive plus liquid clusters do not occur initially but nasal plus homoorganic plosive sequences occur word-finally."
"Hinuq","``Only loan words contain superheavy syllables with two consonants in the coda (e.g. the Avar loans baħs ‘discussion’ and naps ‘personality’)'' (p. 34)."
"Hmong Njua","The cluster <nq> should be transcribed as <ɴq>, but given the absence of /ɴ/, I transcribe it as <ŋq>. The <y:> in the vocalic inventory seems to be a typo, as no such phoneme seems to be present."
"Hunzib","It is uncertain whether VV sequences are tautosyllabic. Here it is assumed they are."
"Ingrian","``In the contemporary language, [the distinction between short and long diphthongs] is not stable, and there is much individual, structurally conditioned, and situational variation'' (p. 311). The long diphthongs were not listed in the source and thus not reflected here. Also not reflected are the``short geminates'', which are reported to contrast with full geminates. Onset clusters are omitted, as ``[c]onsonant clusters are not typical word-initially except in onomatopoeic words and borrowings'' (p. 312)."
"Iron Ossetian","It is unclear whether diphthongs exist. Word-initial and word-final restrictions interpreted as onset and coda restrictions."
"Istro Romanian","The source makes it unclear whether /f/ occurs in the coda position. Here it is left out. It was also unclear whether /u/ or /i/ form part of the onset or coda clusters, in which case the clusters would be transcribed as CV, VC, etc."
"Japanese","The source describes Japanese codas as /H/ (vowel lengthening), /N/ (nasal moraic), and /Q/ (obstruent moraic). /H/ was not included, as it is suprasegmental. The long vowels are coded as separate segments instead. /N/ is realized as [ɴː] in isolation (before pause), so it was transcribed as /ɴ/. /Q/ is also realized as a glottal stop in isolation (in ideophones such as /pikaQ/ [pikaʔ]), so it was transcribed as /ʔ/."
"Japhug","``Not all speakers of Kamnyu Japhug have a phoneme /y/ in the native vocabulary. Even for those speakers, it is only attested in the word ‘fish’ and the verbs derived from it. It nevertheless contrasts with /ɯ/ and /u/, as shown by the quasi-minimal pairs /qaɟy/ ‘fish’, /waɟɯ/ ‘earthquake’ and /ɟuli/ ‘flute’. Other speakers pronounce ‘fish’ with a medial /w/ as /qaɟwi/. However, [y] is found in the speech of all Japhug speakers in Chinese loanwords such as 洋芋 <yángyù> ‘potato’'' (p. 52). Given that the source excludes Mandarin loanword phonology from the phonological analysis, /y/ is excluded from the inventory described here."
"Jerung","It wasn't clear whether the list of nasalized vowels is comprehensive. Here it is assumed to be. It was also unclear whether aspirated consonants appear as coda in Nepali loanwords. Here it is assumed that they don't."
"Jiongnai Bunu","<v̥ ʑ̥> transcribed as /v̤ ʑ̤/."
"Judeo-Tat","Several assumptions about the phonemic equivalent of certain graphemes are made: <ü> = /y/; <ç> = /c͡ç/; <j> = /ʝ/; <r> = /r/."
"Kabardian","I interpret ``non-sonorant syllables'' (pp. 15-16) to be syllabic consonants."
"Kadar","/mph/ is given as a possible medial cluster, but /h/ is not described as part of the phonemic inventory."
"Kaduo","The source records /m³¹/ `right, correct' as an example of a syllable consisting of a syllabic consonant (p. 13), but given that this only example is an interjection, I didn't include any consonant as a possible nucleus here."
"Kajtak","It is unclear what is represented by <ъ> ``laryngeal ejective''. Here it is interpreted as the epiglottal ejective."
"Kangri","``Some of the clusters are intercepted by vocalic glide in slowspeech'' (p. 80). The following statement was not taken into consideration: ``When [/m n r ɾ ɳ l ɭ/] occur as the second members of intervocalic sequences of two consonants and the vowel which precedes is a vowel other than [/ɪ ʊ ə/] these two consonants are the prenuclear margins of the syllable within a phonological word'' (p. 99)."
"Kashubian","It is uncertain what ``post-alveolar fricative trill' represents. Hence it was omitted."
"Kathmandu Valley Newari","It is uncertain whether the borrowed initial clusters described in the source, /pr kl sr sk br kr/, are comprehensive."
"Kelantan-Pattani Malay","It is unclear what is represented by <ʡ>, described as ``a voiced, nasalized, ejective glottal stop ... [that] occurs only in expressives and loanwords'' (p. 182). Hence it was excluded."
"Ket","It is unclear whether /j/ can appear as an onset word-medially. Here, it is assumed that it doesn't. Technically, all biconsonantal codas can appear as long as at least one sonorant is involved. But /l n ŋ/ are syllabified in postconsonantal coda position, so they are treated as syllabic consonants here. /m/ does not oc+AC618cur in that position. While it's unclear whether /j/ can occur in postconsonantal coda position, it is here assumed that it does not, given the absence of examples. Thus, only sonorant-obstruent coda sequences are transcribed here (as <RT>) and sonorant-sonorant and obstruent-sonorant coda sequences are excluded."
"Kharia","``[N]asalisation of vowels is of limited occurrence, mainly in Hindi and other loanwords'' (p. 368). Nasalized vowels are omitted here as the source does not specify which oral vowels have nasal counterparts."
"Khezha Naga","The source suggests that the onset sequences /pr pʰr tr tʰr/ could be analyzed as affricates and not sequences (p. 90) while not including them as affricates in the list of phonemes. Here they are transcribed as sequences."
"Khinalug","``Tonal distinctions have also been noted in Khinalug, but have not been investigated in detail'' (p. 373). Only (word-)initial and final clusters are described comprehensively, without an extensive description of medial clusters. Here the initial and final clusters are coded as onset and coda clusters."
"Khmu","Word-initial and word-final consonants interpreted as onsets and codas given the lect's monosyllabic structure."
"Khroskyabs","Allophonic agreement in complex onsets not reflected in the transcription."
"Kirmanjki","The ``vibrant'' phonemes <r ṙ> interpreted as /ɾ r/."
"Kodava","``Postalveolar affricates'' are transcribed as <t͡ɕ d͡ʑ>. ``Four consonant clusters ... usually consist of an approximant followed by a sequence of nasal plus stop plus trill'' (p. 85). As other four consonant clusters were not described, they are not reflected here."
"Koireng","Unclear whether the complex onsets listed are comprehensive."
"Kölsch","It was unclear whether the list of diphthongs is comprehensive. Here it is assumed to be."
"Komi-Permyak","Based on the standard literary Komi. Word-initial clusters occur only in onomatopoeia and Russian loanwords and were not included here given the lack of description, especially about how many segments are allowed. ``Post-alveolar'' consonants interpreted as palato-alveolar."
"Komi-Zyrian","Word-initial clusters occur only in onomatopoeia and Russian loanwords and were not included here given the lack of description, especially about how many segments are allowed."
"Konda-Dora","The source states that ``[all] clusters generally occur between peaks (vowels)'' (p. 196). Word-final consonant clusters only appear a few times as examples without any comprehensive list. Here it is assumed that only word-internal coda clusters exist, as the source argues that word-internal CCC clusters are best interpreted as CC.C (p. 207). The coda clusters /ln jŋ/ were only described as examples on p. 209 (as part of the triconsonantal clusters /lnd jŋs/)."
"Konkan Marathi","``[B]lade-post-dental affricates'' (p. 34) are interpreted as alveo-palatal affricates."
"Kotia-Adivasi Oriya-Desiya","The Ganjami variety. It is unclear whether the vowel sequences are diphthongs or not. Here it is assumed they are not."
"Ksingmul","It is unclear what <ơ ư> represent. Here they are transcribed as <ə ɨ>. Nasalized vowels and creaky long vowels and diphthongs were briefly mentioned (pp. 22--23) without a comprehensive list of such vowels. Here it is assumed that all oral vowels have their nasalized counterparts and all long vowels and diphthongs their creaky counterparts."
"Kui (India)","It is unclear whether vowel clusters are diphthongs or heterosyllabic. Here they are not assumed to be diphthongs."
"Kulung (Nepal)","Although the source doesn't mention that glides do not appear as codas, I assume that they don't based on their absence in the glossary section (Appendix 3)."
"Kumarbhag Paharia","According to the source, medial clusters can form coda clusters by sentence-internal vowel apocope, such as /mel.qe/ `throat' > /melq.moː.t͡ɕu/ `cut throat'. While it is unclear whether all medial clusters can become coda clusters, here it is assumed that they can."
"Kumyk","``Guttural (гортанные) voiced fricative'' interpreted as /ʁ/."
"Kurukh","The phonemic status of /ɲ/ is uncertain (p. 36)."
"Kuvi","The source gives a list of consonant clusters without distinguishing word-initial and word-medial clusters. Most of the examples given for the clusters depict medial clusters. Here, all the listed clusters are analyzed as medial clusters, while acknowledging the presence of CC as initial cluster."
"Lachi","Vowel cluster appear in Vietnamese loanwords (p. 18). Here they are assumed to be diphthongs."
"Lakkia","The source presents /i y e ɨ u/ as possible vowel codas but the meaning of it was unclear. Only consonant codas are listed here."
"Latvian","<ʃ ʒ tʃ dʒ> are classified as ``alveolar'' but I assume them to be palato-alveolar."
"Laven","Short monophthongs and long monophthongs are transcribed in the source as extra short vowels and normal vowels. Here I transcribe them as normal vowels and long vowels."
"Lepcha","It is unclear whether all oral vowels have nasal counterparts. Here it is assumed that they do. The list of triconsonantal onset cluseters is assuemed to be comprehensive."
"Lishán Didán","There is suprasegmental velarization which lowers the F2 of all the segments of a word or its first few segments. Here it is interpreted as a tone and transcribed as <ˠ>."
"Longchuan Achang","Rhoticized consonants (/Cʐ/) are treated as consonant clusters, contra the monophonemic analysis of the source, as they are absent in PanPhon."
"Lower Sorbian","``Alveolar'' sibilants (transcribed as <tʃ ʃ ʒ>) are interpreted as alveolo-palatal, whereas ``pre-palatal'' (also transcribed as <tʃ ʃ ʒ>) are interpreted as palato-alveolar."
"Macedonian","The source does not mention whether the vowel sequences are homosyllabic. Here they are interpreted as heterosyllabic."
"Maithili","``The use of consonant clusters, especially in initial and final positions, denotes a marked degree of formality and the speaker's knowledge of languages like Sanskrit, Hindi-Urdu, and English. Uneducated speakers of Maithili use the least number of clusters'' (p. 31)."
"Malacca-Batavia Portuguese Creole","Onset consonant clusters were not listed as they tended to be resolved via vowel epenthesis or liquid deletion in the Tugu variety."
"Malayalam","Aspirated consonants treated as unaspirated equivalents, as the source indicates that they are not pronounced with aspiration by all speakers."
"Maltese","Only word-initial and word-final clusters described, word-medial clusters not fully described."
"Manchu","Sanjiazi variety."
"Manipuri","/d̤/ occurs intervocally, but it is not certain whether it occurs word-initially (and therefore as an onset). Here it is assumed to occur as an onset."
"Mao Naga","It is unclear whether diphthongs have nasal counterparts."
"Marathi","According to the source, the initial consonant clusters are absent in ``uneducated'' speech (pp. 547-548). I have thus not listed them here."
"Marwari (India)","In the absence of the description of consonant clusters, it is assumed that (C)V(C) is the syllable template. /ɭ/ is interpreted as only appearing as a coda, given the absence of */-ɭɭ-/ geminate, although the medial clusters were not comprehensively described. It is unclear whether /ɪ̃ ʊ̃/ exist; here it is assumed they do."
"Mewati","Although the source notes that /ɳ ɭ ɽ/ do not occur as onsets (p. 66), given the presence of /lɽ wɭ wɽ/ as medial clusters but not as final clusters and the unlikeliness of /VCC.V/ syllabification, it is assumed that /ɽ ɭ/ occur as onsets contra the source."
"Milang","Ideophones can have different onset clusters not listed here (p. 96). The source reports that Milang is tonal without giving any description of the tone system (p. 103). For convenience, I have transcribed the tones as H and L."
"Miyako","The source notes that ``[t]here is some evidence that G[lide] is not an onset'' (p. 39) but it doesn't explicitly state whether it forms part of the nucleus. Here it is treated as onset."
"Mlabri","The voiceless sonorant onsets, transcribed as <hC> and described as ``partially voiceless'', and sonorant codas with final aspiration, transcribed as <Ch>, are considered to be and transcribed as identical phonemes."
"Modern Hebrew","The source describes <š, ž, tš, dž> as [+cor, -ant], which could either be alveo-palatal, palatal, or palato-alveolar. Here I transcribe them as palato-alveolar. The source also notes that the status of /r/ is not clear."
"Moken","The source reports tone contrast in four pairs of word, e. g. [lək] `to love' (level pitch) and [lə̀k] `a post' (high falling pitch) (p. 24). <c> is described as a plosive, but considering that <cʰ> and <j> are described as palatal affricates, I transcribe <c> as a palatal affricate as well. ``Tense vowels'' are transcribed as vowels with creaky voice."
"Mon","There is a register distinction (``heavy'' and ``light'' registers)."
"Muduga","The alveolar voiceless stop <R> is here transcribed as an aveolar trill, as it is realized as a trill in most positions."
"Naga Pidgin","The diphthongs <ae̞> and <oe̞> were transcribed as <ae> and <oe>, as /e/ and /e̞/ do not seem contrastive."
"Nihali","The source notes that [ə] is phonetically present, but doesn't specify in what contexts it is used."
"North Azerbaijani","Long vowels and non-native consonant cluster patterns that occur in loanwords were not reflected, given the lack of description."
"North Mesopotamian Arabic","The source describes emphatic consonants as velarized, but here they are transcribed as pharyngealized, as they are for all Arabic lects."
"North-Central Dargwa","``If the coda is complex, the first consonant is most frequently either a liquid or a nasal ... codas are predominantly sequences of a sonorant and an obstruent'' (p. 21-22). This would imply that there are exceptions, but here only the sonorant-obstruent sequence is transcribed as the possible complex coda."
"Northern Frisian","Word-initial and word-final constraints interpreted as onset and coda constraints."
"Northern Pashto","The onset and coda clusters are not exhausitively listed in the source, only the most common or frequent ones were. But given their large size, they are listed here as if they were exhaustive."
"Northern Pumi","Contra the source, which views palatalization as a suprasegmental feature, /j/ is analyzed as a part of the onset clusters."
"Northern Uzbek","``Syllable-types in recent borrowings (mainly through Russian)'' (p. 43) include biconsonantal and triconsonantal onsets and triconsonantal codas."
"Nuristani Kalasha","The list of singleton codas was not provided. It is assumed that all medial clusters given by the source are heterosyllabic. /ɹ/ occurs only intervocally or postconsonantally. It is uncertain whether it can occur as a singleton onset. As it occurs as a part of the onset clusters, it is assumed that it occurs as a singleton onset as well. It is uncertain whether /sʈ/ is an initial cluster or a medial cluster, as no example was given. Here it is assumed that it is an intial cluster."
"Occitan","Consonants that are ``phonemically marginal, or are absent in some dialects'' are excluded."
"Odia","It is unclear whether all short oral vowels have long nasal counterparts. Here it is assumed they do. Non-nasal codas may occur in loanwords and onomatopoeia, but given the lack of a comprehensive description, they are not included here."
"Oirad-Kalmyk-Darkhat","The ``weakened'' vowels are assumed to be allophones of short vowels, except for /ə/ which has only a weak variant."
"Ormuri","Logar variety. Only the native stratum reflected. ``Postalveolar'' sibilants interpreted as palato-alveolar."
"Oroch","The list of diphthongs and triphthongs is assumed to be comprehensive."
"Pa-Hng","The Wenjie variety. <pɦ tɦ tɕɦ kɦ qɦ> are transcribed as <b̤ d̤ d͡ʑ̤ ɡ̤ ɢ̤>. The source describes that ``there are eight classes of tones and six values of tones'' (p. 6). Here the tones are transcribed into six tones."
"Pacoh","Vietnamese loanwords may have different onset clusters, which are not included here."
"Paite Chin","The diphthongs transcribed as <Vj> or <Vw> are transcribed as <Vi> and <Vu> respectively, given the absence of the phonemes /j w/."
"Parachi","``Length distinction appears to be unheld only in Persian loans. While there is strong systemic interference from Kaboli Persian, the system of Parachi appears to be more determined by vocalic quality than length, and thus tends toward a system similar to Pashto, except for phonemie ə in the latter'' (p. 694). /v ŋ/ in the phoneme inventory table were transcribed with parantheses but were not specified as loan phonemes. Therefore I assume that they are allophones of other phonemes."
"Pela","It is not certain whether the syllabic consonants described, /m ŋ/, are the only ones."
"Peripheral Mongolian","The source notes that /p/ and /w/ normally appears word-initially but can also appear word-medially and word-finally in some words (p. 18). But it does not provide an example of word-final /w/. Here I interpret the source as both /p/ and /w/ appearing word-finally. The source provides a list of geminates and notes that /nː lː t͡ʃʰː/ can either appear word-finally as syllabic consonants or be divided into two syllables, whereas other geminates can only be divided into two syllables (p. 22-23). Based on this, I interpret /nː lː t͡ʃʰː/ as long consonant phonemes and other geminates as consonant sequences."
"Phom Naga","``Post-alveolar fricative'' <Š> is transcribed here as <ɕ>."
"Piemontese","In the absence of a comprehensive list of word-medial clusters, word-initial and word-final restrictions are interpreted as onset and coda restrictions."
"Portuguese","``Portuguese sequences of [j] + vowel or [w] + vowel are unstable and tend to be pronounced as [i] + vowel or [u] + vowel, respectively. Thus depending on pronunciation style we may have either a diphthong or a hiatus, that is as two contiguous vowels in separate syllables'' (p. 29). The source also provides two possible analyses of nasal vowels: Nasal vowel phonemes or oral vowels followed by /n/ and realized as nasal vowels. Here I interpret them as phonemes."
"Purik-Sham-Nubra","``Many more [onset] clusters are possible in morphologically derived forms, since a


stem final vowel is often turned into a glide in that position, cf. [kʰwa] (< kʰo-a) (p. 36)


`to her/him' ...''"
"Rajbanshi","The distribution of the consonants are only given for word-initial, intervocalic, and word-final positions and the list of word-medial CC clusters were not given. Here, the word-initial and word-final contraints are interpreted as onset and coda constraints."
"Ravula","The syllabification proposed by the source (Section 2.8) is unclear and inconsistent. Given that no finals or complex initials are possible and that medial clusters are biconsonantal except for /jnɡ jmb rnd/, I interpret the biconsonantal medial clusters and coda-onset sequences and /jnɡ jmb rnd/ as /jn.ɡ jm.b rn.d/ based on sonority hierarchy."
"Romanian","It wasn't clear whether the list of complex codas provided by the source was comprehensive."
"Russia Buriat","It is not clear what <š ž č> refers to. Here they are transcribed as alveo-palatal. Although the source states that /nɡ/ is the sole permitted coda cluster in non-Russian words (p. 18), on p. 19 it also reports /mo.ridɕ.ni/ `thy horses' where /dɕ/ is seemingly a coda cluster. Thus, more biconsonantal coda clusters seem to be possible via suffixation."
"Russian","Word-initial and word-final clusters interpreted as onset and coda clusters"
"Rutul","I assume that the ``typical syllablc structures'', CV, CVC, and CVOC (p. 217) are the only possible syllable structures. The sign <:> (as in <q:>) is interpreted as fortis. <r> is interpreted as a trill."
"Sangkong","Mandarin loanwords may have different tones (p. 54). As prenasalized or palatalized initials (but not aspirated initials) are referred to as ``non-simple (非单纯)'' initials, I interpret them as onset clusters."
"Sani","It is not clear what is meant by <z̯>, hence it was excluded."
"Santali","The source does not give a comprehensive list of complex codas and simply describe them as homoorganic nasal + plosive clusters. Based on the examples given and the basic wordlist at the end of the source, I interpret the possible clusters to be nasal plus homoorganic unaspirated voiced plosive clusters, i. e. /mb nd ɲɟ ŋɡ/."
"Scots","<j w> are classified as fricatives but I interpret them as approximants, given that they are described as equivalent to English <y w>."
"Scottish Gaelic","``Velar vibrant'' <R> interpreted as uvular trill."
"Sedang","It is unclear what <r> represents. Here it is assumed to be a trill."
"Selkup","Word-initial and word-final restrictions interpreted as onset and coda restrictions. The source mentions that word-medial triconsonantal clusters rarely occur, but given the absence of their description and their rarity, they are not reflected here."
"Serbian-Croatian-Bosnian","``In special distribution situations, sonants also appear in the function of vowels, above all /r/ and /l/, sporadically /n/ and /ʎ/, while for /ɲ/ and /m/ there is no undisputed lexical confirmation'' (p. 27)."
"Shor","Russian xenophones /f v x t͡s ɕ/ and the non-native syllable types in Russian loanwords are not reflected here."
"Shughni","<š ž x̌ ɣ̌ č ǰ> transcribed as /ɕ ʑ ʃ ʒ t͡ɕ d͡ʑ/."
"Sikkimese","``Lightly aspirated breathy consonants'' transcribed as breathy voiced consonants. Nasalized vowels often alternate with oral vowels with /ŋ/ coda. As there seems to be no minimal distinction between nasal vowels and /Vŋ/ sequence, here it is interpreted that all nasalized vowels are realizations of /Vŋ/."
"Sindhi","The voiced retroflex implosive <ᶑ> in the source is transcribed here as the voiced alveolar implosive <ɗ>, as <ᶑ> is not recognized in the IPA. The source provides VV and VVV sequences without mentioning whether they are diphthongs or triphthongs. Nevertheless, given the phonetic description of these sequences, they are likely not diphthongs or triphthongs."
"Sinte-Manus Romani","The phonemic status of /z/ is marginal and only contrastive word-initially (p. 17)."
"Situ","<tɽ tɽʰ dɽ> transcribed as /ʈ ʈʰ ɖʰ/."
"South Azerbaijani","/ɣ/ does not appear word-initially. Here it is assumed that it also does not appear as an word-internal onset."
"South Levantine Arabic","``Uvularized'' is interpreted as pharyngealized. The ``voiceless post-velar, pre-uvular stop'' <K> (p. 8) is interpreted as the voiceless uvular stop."
"Southeast Pashayi","Nasal + affricate is the only possible word-final consonant cluster. As the word-medial nasal + oral clusters presented in p. 113 are homoorganic, I assume that the possible word-final nasal + affricate clusters are /nt͡ʃ nd͡ʒ/. As no triconsonantal word-medial clusters were given, I assume that there are no word-medial coda clusters."
"Southern Altai","It is uncertain whether all short vowels have long counterparts. Here it is assumed they do. The onset/coda restrictions are inferred from word-initial/medial/final examples."
"Southern Jinghpaw","/pɻ kɻ pʰɻ kʰɻ/ are analyzed as biconsonantal onsets, contrary to the source's analysis, as /ᶈ ᶄ ᶈʰ ᶄʰ/ are absent in PanPhon."
"Southern Kurdish","It wasn't clear what the ``bilabiale continue centrale sonore [voiced central continuant bilabial]'' (p. 173) refers to. Based on its description, I interpret it as /ɥ/."
"Southern Pashto","``Initial clusters'' interpreted as onset clusters."
"Southern Pumi","The ``舌叶前 [prelaminal]'' and ``舌叶后 [postlaminal]'' fricatives (pp. 11-12) are transcribed as /ʃ ʒ/ and /ʃ̠ ʒ̠/, respectively."
"Sri Lanka Malay","The source lists /f ʃ ʒ/ as xenophones in the consonant inventory table but does not discuss it further as phonemes. Personal communication with the author has informed me that prenasalized stops are not permitted at coda position."
"Standard Malay","Same as Indonesian."
"Stau-Dgebshes","The archiphoneme <N> occuring in NC clusters is transcribed as /n/. Although the archiphoneme is realized as the homoorganic nasal to the obstruent ([mp nt ŋk ɴq ɳʈ͡ʂ ...]), given that it is realized as [n] in [nv nw] and not *[ɱ], [n] seems to be most unmarked form."
"Sui","``Alveolo-palatal'' plosives transcribed as palatal /c cʰ ɟ ɟʰ/."
"Swedish","Word-initial and word-final clusters interpreted as onset and coda clusters."
"Tai Do-Mene-Yo","<ï ïï ë ëë> transcribed as /ɨ ɨː ə əː/. It is assumed that an onset is obligatory, given that the source does not mention zero initial."
"Tamil","Loan phonemes were excluded based on the source's assumption that ``distinctive segments brought into the language by the introduction of foreign borrowings should be treated as belonging to a different phonological system than the native one'' (p. 211)."
"Tangam","Identical vowel sequences analyzed as long vowels."
"Tatar","/ŋ/ does not appear at word-initial position and here it is assumed that it also does not appear as word-internal onset. It wasn't clear whether the biconsonantal codas listed in p. 10 are exhaustive, although here they are assumed to be. Furthermore, p. 11 lists biconsonantal codas in loanwords that are unstable and tend to be resyllabified by some speakers by vowel epenthesis: /lqʰ χtʰ ftʰ jχ/. These four are thus excluded. It is not clear whether other biconsonantal clusters are unstable."
"Thakali","Word-initial and word-final restrictions interpreted as onset and coda restrictions."
"Tindi","``Dental'' and ``alveolar'' affricates, described as both ``weak'' and ``strong'' (where ``weak'' is assumed to mean palatalized), are interpreted as alveolo-palatal and palato-alveolar affricates."
"Tsakhur","/q/ only appears word-initially and word-medially and /ʔ/ only appears word-medially and word-finally. It is assumed here that /q/ does not appear as a word-internal coda and that /ʔ/ does not appear as a word-internal onset."
"Tsez","``Consonant clusters are rare and occur word medially in loan words'' (p. 118). Given the absence of word-initial and word-final clusters, I assume that only biconsonantal medial clusters occur."
"Tulu","The segments <h y w>, although described in the source as velar/palatal/labial fricatives, probably refers to /h j w/ rather than /x ʝ β/, based on their overall description. It wasn't clear whether the list of possible consonant clusters are comprehensive; here they are assumed to be."
"Turkmen","Word-initial and word-final constraints interpreted as onset and coda constraints. <š ǰ č> were defined as ``alveolar'' but described as English <sh j ch>. They are thus transcribed here as palato-alveolar."
"Turoyo","Emphatic consonants interpreted as pharyngealized consonants."
"Udihe","Ideophonic consonants not included. The ``diphthongoid'' <ie> is transcribed as /eː/."
"Udmurt","``Postalveolar'' and ``palatal'' sibilants are interpreted as alveolo-palatal and palato-alveolar sibilants, respectively."
"Urum","<č j š ž> interpreted as /t͡ʃ d͡ʒ ʃ ʒ/."
"Vach-Vasjugan","The source notes that CC clusters normally undergo vowel epenthesis but clusters with a homorganic sonorant may forego epenthesis. As epenthesis is optionally present in all CC forms, I have not included CC as a coda form."
"Veps","The diphthongs may be VV or V[vj] sequences, both interpretations being likely (p. 307). Here, they are interpreted as VV sequences."
"Vietnamese","`` The initial consonant may be accompanied by a secondary labial articulation'' (p. 388). Here I interpret this as a complex onset (Cw)."
"Votic","It is unclear what the affricate <š't'š'> represents, hence it was excluded."
"Waddar","It is not clear whether the list of clusters are comprehensive. Here it is assumed to be."
"Wayu","It wasn't clear if the seven vowel qualities all exist as long nasalized vowels. Here it is assumed that all seven exist."
"Welsh","Northern Welsh. The onset clusters include ``citation forms'' and ``mutation forms''."
"West Itelmen","Labialization is treated as a suprasegmental phoneme in the source (§2.3.1)."
"West Yugur","``There is only one instance of an initial consonant cluster: the obsolescent evidential particle -trʊ.'' (p. 28) As it is obsolescent, I have not included it."
"Western Armenian","Loanwords not reflected in the list of codas."
"Western Balochi","The source analyzes the initial part of some word-initial clusters and the final part of some word-final clusters as prependices and semisyllables, respectively. I do not reflect this analysis here as no reason for such analysis was given other than the violation of the sonority hierarchy."
"Western Farsi","Diphthong <ow> here transcribed as <ou>, given that /w/ is absent."
"Western Magar","Syangja variety. It's uncertain whether /t͡sʰ d͡z̤/ appear as coda. Since affricates only appear as coda in Nepali loans (p. 50), and given that /t͡sʰ/ but not /d͡z̤/ appear as coda in Nepali, I assumed that /t͡sʰ/ appear as coda but not /d͡z̤/. The maximal onset length and coda length were not specified, but as only biconsonantal onsets were mentioned, I assume them to be the limit."
"Western Muria","The source analyzes nasalized vowels as sequences of oral vowels and ``vocoid nasal semivowel''. For theoretical consistency, here they are transcribed as nasalized vowels."
"Western Neo-Aramaic","Emphatic consonants interpreted as pharyngealized consonants."
"Western Ong-Be","Lincheng 临城 variety."
"Western Puroik","Nasal vowels are interpreted as underlying VN sequences, as they are realized as nasal vowels in isolation but the nasal coda emerges before plosives (e.g. /ũ̀/ [ũː] `came' vs. /ũ̀-pʰɛ́ʔ/ [umpʰɛʔ] `reached', p. 67). An exception is /ɛ̃/, which is realized as a nasal vowel in all contexts and thus analyzed as a phonemic nasal vowel. The motivation for adopting this alternative analysis (contra the grammarian's view that all /Ṽ/s are monophonemic nasal vowels) is that the comprehensive list of possible nasal vowels and diphthongs including nasal vowels was not given."
"Western Tamang","The source does not mention word-medial clusters, when they apparently exist (e.g. /mjendo/ 'flower', p. 15). Here, the word-final consonants are assumed to be identical to coda consonants."
"Wu Chinese","The Shanghai variety."
"Wuding-Luquan Yi","The source analyzes prenasalized aspirated voiced initials as biconsonantal clusters. Here I analyze them as single consonants, as aspirated voiced consonants do not appear as singleton initials. While glide-vowel and vowel-glide sequences are both permitted, it is unclear which vowels can function as glides."
"Wutunhua","An exhaustive list of onset clusters was not given. However, given the relatively small number of logically possible onset clusters, I interpret that all logically possible onset clusters are present. Although the source analyzes nasal vowels as realizations of a nasal coda, as it never surfaces as VN, I interpret nasal vowels as phonemes."
"Yakkha","The diphthong /au/ was excluded as it only occurs in interjections."
"Zauzou","``The tonemic contrast between /13/ and /35 is not stable'' (p. 58). The glide in a CGV syllable is not phonemic."
"Zbu","The /Cŋ/ biconsonantal coda is unstable (p. 67). The velarized vowels /uˠ iˠ oˠ eˠ/ are not included, as their acoustic difference is minimal (p. 44) and /uˠ/ is not present in PanPhon."
